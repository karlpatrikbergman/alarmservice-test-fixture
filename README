Workflow:

1.
Make sure you have an alarmservice docker image available.

In project alarmservice run:
    ./gradlew clean build buildDocker
Verify newly built image exists:
    docker images

2.
Make sure you have an alarmservice-acceptance-test docker image available
OBS! Since it is (at the moment at least) a Spring application, and not a
Spring boot application it must be build as a fat jar.

In this project run:
    ./gradlew clean fatJar buildDocker
Verify newly built image exists:
    docker images
